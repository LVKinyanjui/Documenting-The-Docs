<h1 align=center> Documenting the Docs </h1>

This project means to gather the documentation from different (software) tools to create a single source of truth. The aim is to have a question and answer RAG system over these docs. This is meant to be great for newbies and those uninitiated in specific technologies to quickly ask a question to the docs directly and get an answer that is as accurate as possible.

The project is only starting out but I hope to pick up pace as the other elements of the pipeline come together.
